# Citibike Business Intelligence

## Brief Description

Citi Bike is a bike share system and becomes one of the essential part of New York Cityâ€™s transportation. However, sometimes the Citi Bike serviec is not satisfactory. During the morning and the afternoon, people usually found that there is no available bike left for rental.Cancel changes Thus it is necessary to use machine learning technologies to provide better service through predicting the total bike rented at each station.

## Project Structure

1. Read and clean the data using *Pandas*
2. Preprocess the data by adding features and select target variables
3. Use the classical machine learning model to predict on both pre-pandemic and post-pandemic data
4. Implement neural network (which still needs to be fine-tuned to performance well)
